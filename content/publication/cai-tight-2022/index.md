abstract: The monotone variational inequality is a central problem in mathematical
  programming that unifies and generalizes many important settings such as smooth
  convex optimization, two-player zero-sum games, convex-concave saddle point problems,
  etc. The extragradient algorithm by Korpelevich [1976] and the optimistic gradient
  descent-ascent algorithm by Popov [1980] are arguably the two most classical and
  popular methods for solving monotone variational inequalities. Despite their long
  histories, the following major problem remains open. What is the last-iterate convergence
  rate of the extragradient algorithm or the optimistic gradient descent-ascent algorithm
  for monotone and Lipschitz variational inequalities with constraints? We resolve
  this open problem by showing that both the extragradient algorithm and the optimistic
  gradient descent-ascent algorithm have a tight {{< math >}}$ O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}) ${{< /math >}} last-iterate
  convergence rate for arbitrary convex feasible sets, which matches the lower bound
  by Golowich et al. [2020a,b]. Our rate is measured in terms of the standard gap
  function. At the core of our results lies a non-standard performance measure --
  the tangent residual, which can be viewed as an adaptation of the norm of the operator
  that takes the local constraints into account. We use the tangent residual (or a
  slight variation of the tangent residual) as the the potential function in our analysis
  of the extragradient algorithm (or the optimistic gradient descent-ascent algorithm)
  and prove that it is non-increasing between two consecutive iterates.
