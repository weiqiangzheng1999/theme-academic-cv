abstract: We consider online learning in multi-player smooth monotone games. Existing
  algorithms have limitations such as (1) being only applicable to strongly monotone
  games; (2) lacking the no-regret guarantee; (3) having only asymptotic or slow (1𝑇√)O(1T)mathcalO(frac1sqrtT)
  last-iterate convergence rate to a Nash equilibrium. While the (1𝑇√)O(1T)mathcalO(frac1sqrtT)
  rate is tight for a large class of algorithms including the well-studied extragradient
  algorithm and optimistic gradient algorithm, it is not optimal for all gradient-based
  algorithms. We propose the accelerated optimistic gradient (AOG) algorithm, the
  first doubly optimal no-regret learning algorithm for smooth monotone games. Namely,
  our algorithm achieves both (i) the optimal (𝑇‾‾√)O(T)mathcalO(sqrtT) regret in
  the adversarial setting under smooth and convex loss functions and (ii) the optimal
  (1𝑇)O(1T)mathcalO(frac1T) last-iterate convergence rate to a Nash equilibrium in
  multi-player smooth monotone games. As a byproduct of the accelerated last-iterate
  convergence rate, we further show that each player suffers only an (log𝑇)O(log⁡T)mathcalO(log
  T) individual worst-case dynamic regret, providing an exponential improvement over
  the previous state-of-the-art (𝑇‾‾√)O(T)mathcalO(sqrtT) bound.
