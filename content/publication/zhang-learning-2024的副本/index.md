abstract: 'We study policy optimization algorithms for computing correlated equilibria in multi-player general-sum Markov Games. Previous results achieve {{< math >}}$\tilde{O}(T^{-1/2})${{< /math >}} convergence rate to a correlated equilibrium and an accelerated {{< math >}}$\tilde{O}(T^{-3/4})${{< /math >}} convergence rate to the weaker notion of coarse correlated equilibrium. In this paper, we improve both results significantly by providing an uncoupled policy optimization algorithm that attains a near-optimal {{< math >}}$\tilde{O}(T^{-1})${{< /math >}} convergence rate for computing a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is constructed by combining two main elements (i) smooth value updates and (ii) the \emph{optimistic-follow-the-regularized-leader} algorithm with the log barrier regularizer.'
