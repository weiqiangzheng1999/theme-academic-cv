abstract: "A new mobile attention economy has emerged with the explosive growth of
  short-video apps such as TikTok. In this internet market, three types of agents
  interact with each other: the platform, influencers, and advertisers. A short-video
  platform encourages its influencers to attract users by creating appealing content
  through short-form videos and allows advertisers to display their ads in short-form
  videos. There are two options for the advertisers: one is to bid for platform advert
  slots in a similar way to search engine auctions; the other is to pay an influencer
  to make engaging short videos and promote them through the influencer's channel.
  The second option will generate a higher conversion ratio if advertisers choose
  the right influencers whose followers match their target market. Although displaying
  influencer ads will generate less revenue, it is more engaging than platform ads,
  which is better for maintaining user traffic. Therefore, it is crucial for a platform
  to balance these factors by establishing a sustainable business agreement with its
  influencers and advertisers. In this paper, we develop a two-stage solution for
  a platform to maximize short-term revenue and long-term user traffic maintenance.
  In the first stage, we estimate the impact of user traffic generated by displaying
  influencer ads and characterize the user traffic the platform should allocate to
  influencers for overall revenue maximization. In the second stage, we devise an
  optimal (1-1/e)-competitive algorithm for ad slot allocation. To complement this
  analysis, we examine the ratio of the revenue generated by our online algorithm
  to the optimal offline revenue. Our simulation results show that this ratio is 0.94
  on average, which is much higher than (1-1/e) and outperforms four baseline algorithms."
