 abstract = {We study first-order methods for constrained min-max optimization. Existing methods either require two gradient calls or two projections in each iteration, which may be costly in some applications. In this paper, we first show that a variant of the \emph\Optimistic Gradient (OG)\ method, a \emph\single-call single-projection\ algorithm, has \$O(\frac\1\\\sqrt\T\\)\$ best-iterate convergence rate for inclusion problems with operators that satisfy the weak Minty variation inequality (MVI). Our second result is the first single-call single-projection algorithm -- the \emph\Accelerated Reflected Gradient (ARG)\ method that achieves the \emph\optimal \$O(\frac\1\\T\)\$\ last-iterate convergence rate for inclusion problems that satisfy negative comonotonicity. Both the weak MVI and negative comonotonicity are well-studied assumptions and capture a rich set of non-convex non-concave min-max optimization problems. Finally, we show that the \emph\Reflected Gradient (RG)\ method, another \emph\single-call single-projection\ algorithm, has \$O(\frac\1\\\sqrt\T\\)\$ last-iterate convergence rate for constrained convex-concave min-max optimization, answering an open problem of [Hsieh et al., 2019]. Our convergence rates hold for standard measures such as the tangent residual and the natural residual.},
